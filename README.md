# RightOn Education

## Project Description

[**_RightOn!_**](https://www.rightoneducation.com) is an app-based classroom activity that increases engagement and helps more students feel better about math: think Kahoot/Fibbage + math + learning from and having fun with wrong answers. Rather than focusing on just increasing math proficiency -- which can leave behind many disengaged and underserved youth -- **_RightOn!_** is also working to increase self-confidence and self-efficacy through an engaging activity that applies research into learning from mistakes and common misconceptions.

## Getting Started

### 1) Clone project

`git clone https://github.com/righton-dev/righton-app.git`

### 2) Install node modules

`npm install`

### 3) Install on device

`npm run ios`

`npm run android`

### 4) Start your app

`npm start`

## Files needed / Additional notes

The `react-native` npm package.

A `local.properties` file if testing on Android.

The Xcode editor if testing on iOS.

### AWS

There has to be a file `aws-exports.js` file placed under `src/` directory. This file is not checked into the Github. It must be obtained separately from the admin of this project so that the project can properly communicate with the AWS cloud services during runtime.

### Note

Some NPM packages may be out of date and need to be updated for the Android build.

If you encounter the following error:

> A problem occurred evaluating project ':amazon-cognito-identity-js'.
> Could not find method implementation() for arguments [com.facebook.react:react-native:+]

Locate the `build.gradle` file in `node_modules/amazon-cognito-identity.js/android`, find the line mentioned in the `dependencies` object, and change `implementation` to `compile`.

If you receive a `hasteImpl returning the same name for different files` error in your packager. This is due to identical path names created by AWS Amplify. To fix this issue, simply drag the `#current-cloud-backend` folder from `${root}/amplify` out, restart the packager and run again.

## Help Wanted!

Weâ€™re looking to work with people who are interested in making a difference in youth education. We are building mobile apps on AWS using technologies including React Native, Node.js, DynamoDB, and Amplify/Lambda. Experience with AI/ML is a plus.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from everyone. Please report issues directly to us or make Pull Requests for any features or bug fixes. As much as we like to reward mistakes, we want to fix as many of them as possible too. Your contribution counts!
